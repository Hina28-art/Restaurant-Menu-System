# Restaurant-Menu-System
This Java code implements a simple restaurant menu management system that allows users to add menu items and display the current menu through a command-line interface. The RestaurantMenuSystem class serves as the main entry point, using a Scanner for user input. Users can add items (name, description, and price) and view the menu. The MenuItem class represents individual items, while the Menu class manages a collection of these items using an ArrayList. The program runs in a loop, continuously prompting the user until they choose to exit.
